#  Wind Energy Ontology (WEO)
Wind Energy Ontology (WEO) is a domain-level ontology which aims to provide a high-level representation of wind energy concepts. WEO serves as a middle layer between top- and mid-level ontologies and more specialized application-specific models.

Currently the following ontologies are considered:
 - **Top and middle level**: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) Core.
 - Allignement with other **domain-level ontologies**: Open Energy Onology (OEO),  Environment Ontology  (ENVO), Reference Designation Standards for Wind Power Systems (RDS for WPS)
 - **Application and task specific level**: Failure Modes Effects and Critically Analysis for Wind Turbines (FMECA4WT), Blade Anomaly Ontology


 WEO has four main objectives. 
- Domain coverage, by capturing key entities and processes in wind energy to ensure comprehensive representation. 
- Alignment across semantic layers, by offering a consistent semantic bridge that links foundational ontologies to specialized taxonomies and controlled vocabularies. 
- Foundation for FAIR data, supporting community-driven standards to make wind energy data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for humans.
- Enhance AI readiness, by providing a unified framework that can serve as a basis for KG, RAG, and hybrid AI systems.
